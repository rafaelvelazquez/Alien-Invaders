*First personal game*

Run Game.java to play

**Background music was disabled since original audio file size was to large to upload.
Note: You can play your own music if you want by removing the '//' around the 6 instances of bgm and placing your own music files when the bgm gets initialized (bgm1, bgm2). Use (.wav) files for no issues running.**
